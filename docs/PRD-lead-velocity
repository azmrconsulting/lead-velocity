# Product Requirements Document: Lead Velocity (FSBO AI Caller)

## Overview

Automated system that scrapes FSBO listings, calls owners via AI voice, qualifies them, and books appointments with a real estate agent.

## Problem

Agents lack time to call leads quickly. Speed to contact wins listings. Manual calling is inconsistent.

## Solution

1. Scrape FSBO listings daily from Zillow (Morris County, NJ initially)
2. Store leads in Google Sheet
3. Trigger AI voice calls via Vapi within minutes
4. Qualify through natural conversation
5. Book qualified leads on Google Calendar
6. Notify agent

**Workflow 2: Call Results**
- Trigger: Vapi webhook
- Parse results → Update Sheet → If qualified: book calendar + notify

**Workflow 3: Retry (future)**
- Find No Answer + attempts < 3 → Retry call

### 4. Vapi Voice Agent

**Config:**
```json
{
  "name": "FSBO Qualifier",
  "voice": "jennifer",
  "firstMessage": "Hi, is this the owner of the property on {address}?",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "maxDurationSeconds": 300
}
```

**Script summary:**
- Confirm owner
- Intro: calling on behalf of [AGENT] with [BROKERAGE], saw FSBO listing
- Value prop: agents often net sellers more even after commission
- Qualify: timeline, showings, why FSBO, open to agent help
- If qualified: book phone call or in-person meeting
- Handle objections: commission concerns, already have agent, not interested

**Data to capture:**
- qualified (bool)
- timeline (string)
- reason_selling (string)
